# Network_Load
C++ app to simulate the load on an optical network.
###To-Do:
1. Rall Symposium Abstract
2. Phase 0.5
	* Finish CPU implementation
	* Measure CPU running time
	* **This needs to be done for Rall.**
3. Phase 1
	* Develop technique for splitting up work accross cores
	* Implement algorithm for GPU
	* Measure GPU running time
4. Phase 2
	* Compare CPU/GPU running time
	* **If we have this for Rall, that would be dope.**
